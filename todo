fix the structure so that all layers run simultaneously
fix the nodes so that they can fit in a hierarchy
test

add noise to r'

try more layers?
try hierarchy
try just tuning the bunch of learning rates?

reasons why it wouldn't work: 
step size, noise too big for input signal - currently it's still whacky for constant input so no
